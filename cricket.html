        <h2>ABOUT</h2><div class="about">
    <div >  <p>Cricket is a popular sport with a long history. It was invented in the 16th century in England,
         but it was a long time before modern rules were used.<br>It is played between two teams of eleven players each.
          One team, which is batting, tries to score runs, while the other team is fielding, and tries to prevent this.<br>
           Runs are scored by hitting the ball, which is thrown by a player from the fielding team to a player from the
            batting team, across the boundary,<br> or by the two batting players running back-and-forth between the two wickets.<br><br><B><U>FORMATS</U></B><br>1. Test Matches: These are the longest format of the game and can last up to five days. Each team has two innings,
             and the team that scores<br> the most runs and takes the most wickets wins.
            <br>2. One Day Internationals (ODIs): Limited to 50 overs per side, with each team batting and bowling for a set number of overs. These matches are<br> usually completed in one day.
            <br>3.Twenty20 (T20): The shortest format, with each team limited to 20 overs. T20 matches are known for their fast-paced and entertaining nature.</p></div>
